Here are some additional details about the code: BookingController

What makes it amazing code?
=================
1) Uses the Laravel framework to handle various operations, such as handling user requests, processing user data, and returning responses.
2) Uses Model-View-Controller (MVC) architectural pattern to achieve a separation of concerns.
3) The code follows the PSR-2 coding standard.
4) Appropriate naming conventions for methods, variables, and classes.

What makes it Ok code?
=================
1) There are no comments that explain the purpose of specific methods or variables, making it difficult for other developers to understand the code.
2) No test cases are provided.

What makes it terrible code? How would you have done it?
=================
1) Hard-coded values that could lead to future issues. For example, the ADMIN_ROLE_ID and SUPERADMIN_ROLE_ID are hard coded. Instead, these values should be stored in a configuration file.
2) The code is using the array_except function, which is deprecated and removed from later versions of Laravel. Instead, the Arr::except helper function should be used to remove specific keys from an array.
3) The immediateJobEmail method is sending an email directly, which could lead to issues such as email delivery failures. Instead, a more reliable option such as a message queue or notification system should be used.
4) The controller has too many methods, which could be split into separate controllers for better code organization
5) distanceFeed: The isset() function is used unnecessarily to check if a variable exists and is not null, which is redundant because the empty() function can handle both cases.
6) No use of type-hinting: The lack of type-hinting makes it unclear what type of data is being passed to the function, making it harder to debug issues.

What can be changed with this code to show as good code?
=================
1) Extract the magic numbers and hard-coded strings to configuration files or constants to make them more manageable.
2) Add comments to explain the purpose of specific methods or variables.
3) The index(), show(), store(), and update() functions now take a Request object as an argument. This allows the functions to access the user's input, such as the job ID.
4) The functions now use the validated() method to validate the user's input.
5) The functions now call the store(), getUsersJobs(), with(), find(), updateJob(), or getAll() method on the repository, depending on the function.
6) The functions now return the response from the repository.
7) The distance and time parameters are now optional, so that the function can be used to update existing records as well as create new ones.
8) The distance_model and job_model objects are now created using the firstOrNew() method, which ensures that the records are only created if they do not already exist.
9) The save() method is now used to save the updated records to the database.
6) The response() method is now used to return a success message to the user.

Thank you!
